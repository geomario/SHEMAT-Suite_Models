# Conceptual Model of the BHEs
## Single U-BHE
Borehole heat exchangers are commonly installed in the subsurface to satisfy low enthalpy energy demands. [SHEMAT][f2cfa652] software has the ability to simulate three most typical BHEs configurations.

  [f2cfa652]: https://www.springer.com/de/book/9783540438687 "Numerical Simulation of Reactive Flow in Hot Aquifers"

1. Single-U-tube
2. Double-U
3. Coaxial

In this example we will set the example for a single-U-tube within SHEMAT. In the figure 1, the illustration of a normal configuration of a Single U-tube-BHE. The U-BHE are normally sealed with another material, rather than direct contact with the rock mass. The name for a U-BHE comes from the U shape of the pipelines buried in the subsurface.
