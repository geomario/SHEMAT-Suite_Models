# Model 2D Fancy Geology - Free Convection #

This is a 2D benchmark model for pressure-based computation of free convection with a more complex geological structure. In comparison, model `fw_bas_2Dfancy_FreeConvection`
is an example for the head-based simulation of the same model. 

It has 220*1*119 cells with 50*50*50 m discretization.
